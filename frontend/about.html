              My name is Bastien Le Gall, and I am a Full-Stack Developer with a
              strong focus on the JavaScript ecosystem, particularly React and
              Node.js. My experience lies in building robust, end-to-end
              applications and managing cloud infrastructures on AWS.

              This dashboard is a live demonstration of my skills. It serves as
              the central monitoring interface for my home server, a Linux
              system running over 20 Docker containers and managing 100TB of ZFS
              storage.
            </p>
            <p>
              The primary goal of this project was to create a highly efficient,
              minimalist, and real-time monitoring tool. The backend is
              developed in Go, chosen specifically for its performance and low
              resource consumption, while the frontend is built with standard
              HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure maximum speed and
              compatibility.
            </p>
            <h4>This project showcases several key competencies:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Backend Development:</strong> Building a lightweight and
                efficient API with Go.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Frontend Development:</strong> Crafting a clean and
                responsive user interface from scratch.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>System Administration:</strong> Managing and monitoring
                a complex Docker-based infrastructure.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> The dashboard is fully optimized for its primary use on desktop, achieving perfect 100 scores across all Google Lighthouse categories (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO). This result underscores a strong focus on creating a fast and high-quality user experience under real-world conditions.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              It's a practical application of the skills listed on my resume,
              proving my ability to deliver high-quality, performant solutions.
